# Invoiced – Landing Page

A lightweight landing page for Invoiced, a project that makes invoice payments simple using Bitcoin. This site focuses on a fast hero experience, a short product overview, and a clear call‑to‑action to start using the app.

## What this is
- A static landing page (`invoice-payment-app/index.html`) optimized for quick render
- Sections include: Header, Hero, Product highlights, CTA, and FAQ
- Extra JS hardening removes decorative elements (stars/lines) and keeps FAQ visible

## How to view
- Open `invoice-payment-app/index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static server (for example):
  - Node: `npx serve invoice-payment-app`
  - Python: `python -m http.server -d invoice-payment-app 8080`

## Project goal (short)
Invoiced helps individuals and teams create and pay invoices in Bitcoin with an experience that’s familiar, fast, and secure. The landing page introduces the value, then routes users to the app to get started.
