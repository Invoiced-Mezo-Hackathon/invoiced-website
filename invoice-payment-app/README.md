Invoiced is a web-based invoicing and payment platform that lets freelancers and businesses create Bitcoin-denominated invoices, receive payments instantly, and access spendable cash without selling their BTC. It’s built on Mezo, a Bitcoin-backed liquidity network that issues mUSD, a stable digital dollar collateralized by Bitcoin.

## 💡 Vision
Invoiced is building a bridge between freelancers and the Bitcoin economy — one invoice at a time. By integrating Mezo’s liquidity layer, we’re making Bitcoin not just a store of value, but a tool for real work.
